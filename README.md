## 🧐 Purpose <a name = "purpose"></a>
At the beginning of 2022 I learned C, which was a bit difficult, since I had just learned Python. To practice C and understand how Linux commands work, I coded some of the commands in its console.

## 🖇 Repository content <a name="repository_content"></a>
I have implemented the fork command and the cat (mycat), possibly I will implement some more in the future.
